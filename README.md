
## Species Distribution and Habitat Modeling  
### CSP4220

### Course Description 

This course will provide participants with the skills needed to build species distribution and habitat models (SDHMs) for use in management and conservation planning. Topics explored include:

* Data acquisition, organization, and vetting; 
* Model construction and prediction; 
* Assessment and evaluation; and 
* Decision-risk associated with SDHM implementation. 

Participants will learn to apply these skills in R through hands-on exercises, with an intent to transfer the skills learned to a SDHM related to their work environment.

### Objectives 

Upon completion of this course, participants will be able to:

* Be conversant in the philosophical and ecological underpinnings of SDHMs
* Acquire, organize, and evaluate response and predictor data for a SDHM, with emphases on 
  * True presence:absence vs. presence-only data; 
  * The relationships of environmental an geographic coverage to sample frames; and 
  * Pre--analysis strategies for exploring characteristics of the response and predictor variables.
* Apply 5 different statistical methods to build predictive SDHMs
* Evaluate & assess SDHM performance, including estimation of uncertainties
* Construct, evaluate and present ensembles of SDHM outputs
